Sweetcron is no longer under active development. This app was written in 2008 and is beginning to show its age a little, but it might be useful to some people so I put it up here on Github. I'm now a happy Ruby on Rails developer so even I might not understand how Sweetcron works anymore... don't ask me!

##Documentation
For now is still at Google Code:
